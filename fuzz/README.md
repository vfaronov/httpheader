# Fuzzing httpheader with go-fuzz

Here are some tools for running [go-fuzz](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz)
on httpheader's parsers.

Install go-fuzz:

    go get -u github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz/go-fuzz{,-build}

The following instructions assume a GNU userland. 
If they don't work for you, run `go-fuzz-build` and `go-fuzz` manually.

Fuzz each header (for which a `*.fuzz` directory has been prepared)
for several minutes:

    make *.fuzz

Fuzz the WWW-Authenticate header for an hour:

    make WWW-Authenticate.fuzz TIME=1h

Clean up everything generated by go-fuzz 
(will error if any crashers have been found):

    make clean
